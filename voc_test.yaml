# Define class names:

# Value MUST match the corresponding CLASS NAME in your ground truth XMLs.
names:
  0: PEDESTRIAN_SIDE  # Model predicts 0 -> Evaluate against GT 'PEDESTRIAN_SIDE'
  1: OPERATOR         # Model predicts 1 -> Evaluate against GT 'OPERATOR'
  2: FORKLIFT         # Model predicts 2 -> Evaluate against GT 'FORKLIFT'
  # --- Include ALL other ground truth classes below ---
  # Assign them subsequent indices. They need to be listed so the
  # loader recognizes them in the GT files, even if the model
  # won't predict these specific IDs.
  3: REACH_TRUCK      # Exact name from GT
  4: ORDER_PICKER     # Exact name from GT
  5: STACKER          # Exact name from GT
  # Add any others if they exist in your GT XMLs.
  # 'background' is usually implicit and not needed here.
